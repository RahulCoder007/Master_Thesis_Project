# Scheduling and Load Balancing Framework for Security Aware Fog Networks (SOFNET)

Proposed Scheduling and Load Balancing Framework for Security Aware Fog Networks (SOFNET), our proposed
approach distributes job load across the fog network and schedules real-time jobs based on deadline, communication
delay, size, resource utilisation, and security constraints.

## How to run this code

First need to run `create_workload.py` in order to create datasets.
Then run `simulate.py` and it will automatically give the desired results.
